# ECHOCAT WebSocket Protocol Reference

This is the catalog of every WebSocket message that flows between POTACAT
desktop and an ECHOCAT client (browser today, native mobile app coming).
The schemas of record live in [`lib/echocat-protocol.js`](../lib/echocat-protocol.js).
This document is the human index — what each message means and which feature
uses it.

## Versioning

The current protocol version is **`1`**. See `PROTOCOL_VERSION` in
`lib/echocat-protocol.js`.

A connecting client should send `{type: 'hello', protocolVersion, clientVersion, clientPlatform}`
immediately after the WebSocket opens. The server replies with
`{type: 'hello', protocolVersion, serverVersion, capabilities}`. If the
major version differs by more than 1, either side should close with code
`4001` ("protocol version unsupported"). Within the same major, missing
features should be advertised through the `capabilities` array on the
server `hello`, so the client can hide UI for things the server doesn't
yet support.

The legacy browser web app does **not** send a `hello` — when the server
sees its first message be `auth` instead of `hello`, it falls back to
protocol-version 0 behavior (which is "everything works as it did before
the handshake was added"). This is the v0 ↔ v1 compatibility bridge that
keeps the existing browser path working unchanged. See
`lib/echocat-protocol.js > LEGACY_FIRST_MESSAGE_TYPES` for the allowed
legacy first messages.

> **Live-desktop caveat:** the v1 server hello only fires on a desktop
> running a build that includes commits `62bec7e` + `44c1aac` or later.
> A desktop running an older binary still serves the legacy v0 path
> (no server `hello` is sent). If your client connects and times out
> waiting for the server's `hello`, check that the desktop has been
> restarted onto the new build. Don't assume v1 capabilities just
> because the desktop repo is on v1 — the running process still
> matters. (Gap 4, mobile dev report 2026-05-03.)

## Connection lifecycle

```
client                                 server
  |---- TLS handshake ----------------> |
  |---- WS upgrade -------------------> |
  | <---- {type:'hello', ...} --------- |  (skipped pre-v1; legacy clients see auth-mode first)
  |---- {type:'hello', ...} ----------> |
  | <---- {type:'auth-mode', mode} ---- |
  |---- {type:'auth', ...} -----------> |
  | <---- {type:'auth-ok'|'auth-fail'} -|
  |  ... feature messages flow ...      |
```

## Message catalog

Format: each row is `name — direction — purpose`. Directions:
**S→C** (server-to-client), **C→S** (client-to-server), **↔** (both).

### Handshake / auth / connection

| Message | Dir | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `hello` | ↔ | Version + capability handshake (new in v1). Server-side `hello` also carries top-level `rigModel` (string, e.g. `"Flex 8600M"`, `"FTDX10"`) so POTACAT-desktop clients can label paired shacks in the Remote Radios panel — empty string when no rig is configured. |
| `auth-mode` | S→C | Tell client which auth mode the server is configured for (`token`, `callsign`, `cloud`). |
| `auth` | C→S | Submit credentials (token / callsign+password / cloud token). |
| `auth-ok` | S→C | Auth succeeded. Bundles initial feature flags and settings. Per-device-token auths also include `expiresAt` (epoch ms or `null` for no-expiry — trusted / account-linked devices), `accountLinked` (bool — pair came in via Cloud-attested flow), and `trusted` (bool — operator marked the device "my own"). Absent for the legacy single-shared-token path and Guest Pass auth. |
| `auth-fail` | S→C | Auth rejected with `reason`. New reason in v1.9: `"expired"` — paired device's sliding 180-day token elapsed without a reconnect; client should route to the re-pair UI. |
| `kicked` | S→C | Server bumped this client because another connected. Carries `byPlatform`, `byVersion`, `byHost` so the displaced client can render a friendly "another device took over" banner instead of a mystery disconnect. |
| `revoked` | S→C | The shack operator revoked this device's pairing **while it was connected** (Settings → paired devices → Revoke). Carries `reason` (display string). Sent immediately before the server closes the socket with code `4004`. Unlike `kicked`, the device token no longer exists — the client must drop to its unpaired state and must **not** auto-reconnect (a reconnect gets a terminal `auth-fail`; the server can't distinguish revoked from never-paired once the record is deleted). Only the matching per-device pairing is kicked; legacy shared-token and Guest Pass sessions are unaffected (pass revocation has its own `pass-ended` flow). New 2026-06-12. |
| `pong` | S→C | Reply to `ping` for connection health checks. |
| `ping` | C→S | Latency / liveness probe. |

#### WebSocket close codes

Application close codes (mirrored in `CLOSE_CODES` in
`lib/echocat-protocol.js` and mobile's `src/protocol/echocatProtocol.ts`
— keep the two in sync):

| Code | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `4001` | `PROTOCOL_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED` | Peer's protocol major is too far ahead/behind to talk. |
| `4002` | `HANDSHAKE_INVALID` | Malformed `hello`. |
| `4003` | `AUTH_FAILED_TERMINAL` | Auth rejected and retrying won't help — stop reconnecting. |
| `4004` | `AUTH_REVOKED` | Operator revoked this device's pairing mid-session. Preceded by a `revoked` message. Don't reconnect. Older clients that don't know `4004` ignore the `revoked` message, treat the close as generic, reconnect once, and land on a terminal `auth-fail` — degraded but safe. |

### Spots and sources

| Message | Dir | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `spots` | S→C | Bulk push of current spot list. |
| `sources` | S→C | Which spot sources are currently enabled (POTA, SOTA, etc.). |
| `set-sources` | C→S | Toggle which spot sources to subscribe to. |
| `echo-filters` | S→C | Server-side filter state (band/mode/distance). |
| `set-echo-filters` | C→S | Update server-side filter state. |
| `worked-parks` | S→C | List of park refs the user has worked (drives ATNO badges). |
| `worked-qsos` | S→C | List of recent worked callsigns/refs (drives "worked" highlighting). |

### Rig control / VFO

The `status` message is a kitchen-sink snapshot. The canonical fields are:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `freq` | number | Hz. **Not `frequency`.** |
| `mode` | string | "USB", "LSB", "CW", "PKTUSB", "FREEDV-RADEV1", … |
| `band` | string | "20m", "40m", … (derived from freq) |
| `catConnected` | boolean | true when CAT or SmartSDR is up |
| `txState` | boolean | true while transmitting |
| `rigType` | string | "flex", "yaesu", "icom", "kenwood", "rigctld", "wsjtx" |
| `nb` | boolean | Noise blanker on/off |
| `atu` | boolean | ATU enabled |
| `vfo` | string | "A" or "B" |
| `filterWidth` | number | Hz |
| `rfgain` | number | 0–255 |
| `txpower` | number | TX power *setting* (slider) |
| `smeter` | number | live S-meter (Gap 10) |
| `swr` | number | live SWR (Gap 10) |
| `alc` | number | live ALC (Gap 10) |
| `power` | number | live wattmeter (Gap 10) |
| `capabilities` | object | per-rig feature flags (filter, nb, atu, vfo, rfgain, txpower, power) |
| `vfoLocked` | boolean | VFO lock active |
| `audioState` | string | WebRTC connection state (when ECHOCAT audio bridge is up) |

**`tune` C→S sends `freqKhz` (string), not `frequency` (number)**.
The kHz-as-string format is the legacy wire shape and the desktop
parses it as a float — see Gap 5 in `potacat-app/docs/echocat-protocol-gaps.md`
for the history.

| Message | Dir | Purpose |
|---|---|---|

On mutual exclusion (one rig) a side that sees the peer's `scanning:true` stops its own engine. Re-sent to a (re)connecting client so a mid-scan reconnect shows the in-progress scan. |
| `scan-control` | ↔ | Ask the peer to change ITS scan. Field: `action` (string): `"stop"` (the reported use-case) or `"start"` (optional; uses that side's own filters). Gated like other rig C→S (authenticated active client). NOTE: supersedes the older, unused `scan:state`/`scan:control` (colon) registrations. |
| `rig-control` | C→S | Generic raw-CAT passthrough button (Settings → Rig table). |

### Cloud (cross-device QSO sync via Cognito)

> **Scope:** These messages exist solely for the in-browser ECHOCAT UI
> (`renderer/remote.html` Settings → Cloud Sync, wired in
> `renderer/remote.js:8132-8289`), which piggybacks on the desktop's
> cloud session over WebSocket. The iOS and Android apps do **not** use
> these — they speak to `api.potacat.com` directly over HTTPS via their
> own `CloudAuth` / `CloudSync` clients. Don't infer from the protocol
> registry that mobile is expected to send them; that path was never
> wired on the native apps and was retired from the mobile protocol
> registry in the 2026-05-27 cleanup. The desktop-side handlers stay in
> place to serve the browser ECHOCAT.

| Message | Dir | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `cloud-login` | C→S | Log in to POTACAT cloud account. |
| `cloud-login-result` | S→C | Login result. |
| `cloud-register` | C→S | Sign up. |

| `cloud-verify-result` | S→C | Subscription tier response. |
| `cloud-save-bmac-email` | C→S | Save Buy-Me-A-Coffee email for benefit lookup. |
| `cloud-bmac-result` | S→C | BMAC lookup result. |

### KiwiSDR / WebSDR

| Message | Dir | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `kiwi-connect` | C→S | Connect to a KiwiSDR / WebSDR station. |
| `kiwi-disconnect` | C→S | Disconnect. |

(KiwiSDR audio/state events are sent over the existing audio channel and
the broader `status` message; no dedicated S→C envelope today.)

### Voice macros / settings

| Message | Dir | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `voice-macro-sync` | ↔ | Voice-macro recording. C→S: phone uploads. S→C: desktop pushes existing recordings to a new client. Fields: `idx`, `label`, `audio` (base64 WebM). |
| `voice-macro-delete` | C→S | Remove a stored recording. |
| `voice-macro-labels` | S→C | Five-slot label array for voice-macro buttons (sent on connect + on changes). |
| `save-echo-pref` | C→S | Persist an ECHOCAT-only preference (no settings.json round-trip). |
| `save-custom-cat-buttons` | C→S | Save user-defined raw-CAT buttons for the Rig table. |
| `colorblind-mode` | S→C | Server says colorblind mode is on (affects accent colors). |
| `cluster-state` | S→C | DX-cluster connection state for the cluster badge. |
| `qrz-names` | S→C | `{CALLSIGN: 'First Last'}` map after a batch QRZ lookup — drives the spot-row Name column. |

### Diagnostics (Unified Bug Report)

Canonical contract: `status/brief-bug-report-{desktop,mobile}.md`.

| Message | Dir | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `request-diagnostic` | ↔ | "Report a Bug" on either side asks the other for a diagnostic snapshot. Fields: `requestId` (string, echoed in the reply), `redact` (optional bool — when true the reply is safe to paste into a PUBLIC report). |
| `diagnostic-snapshot` | ↔ | Reply carrying the SAME `requestId`. Fields: `source` (`"desktop"`/`"mobile"`), `appVersion`, `platform` (object `{os, osVersion, deviceModel}`), `timestamp` (ISO 8601 string), `sections` (object — see below), and `error` (string, present instead of `sections` on refusal/failure). |

Both types are **bidirectional** (`Dir.BOTH`) — either side can be requester
or responder. `sections` is an untyped any-bag so it can evolve in lockstep
with the mobile `BugReportAssembler` without a protocol-version bump. Desktop
sections: `account`, `connection`, `pairedDevices`, `rig`, `tailscale`,
`cloudTunnel`, `logLines` (`string[]`); mobile adds `network` and omits the
desktop-only ones. Every field except `requestId` is optional: a refused or
failed gather returns `error` and no `sections` so the requester never sits
on its 5s timeout. When `redact:true`, the responder masks email, IPs (to
/24, loopback preserved), and JWT/Bearer/long-token strings in `logLines`.
Both sides advertise `diagnostic-snapshot` in their `hello.capabilities` so
the requester short-circuits to NOT REACHABLE against an old peer instead of
waiting on the timeout. **Security deviation (desktop):** a Guest Pass
session is refused (`error: "not-authorized"`) rather than handed the host's
diagnostics.

### Pairing (new in v1, see Phase 0 plan)

| Message | Dir | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| *(none yet — pairing happens via HTTP `POST /api/pair`, not WebSocket)* | | |

#### Pairing QR payload

The desktop emits a `potacat://pair?<params>` URL encoded into a QR code
(generated by the `echocat-create-pairing-qr` IPC handler in `main.js`).
The mobile app scans it to bootstrap a paired-device record.

| Param | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | yes | LAN WebSocket URL — `wss://<ip-or-tailscale-name>:7300`. The phone connects here first. |
| `token` | yes | One-time pairing token minted by `remoteServer.createPairingToken()`. Short-lived (5 min default; 60 min when shared via messaging). |
| `fp` | yes | SHA-256 fingerprint of the desktop's TLS cert. The phone pins this for the LAN connection. |
| `name` | yes | `os.hostname()` of the desktop — shown in the phone's paired-device list. |
| `cloudHost` | **optional** *(added 2026-06-01 for POTACAT Cloud)* | The CF-tunneled hostname, e.g. `k3sbp.potacat.com` (the pattern is `<callsign>.potacat.com`; always returned by the cloud /provision endpoint, never constructed client-side). Present only when the desktop has POTACAT Cloud enabled and the tunnel is provisioned (file `userData/cloud-tunnel.json` exists with `enabled:true`). Phone uses LAN first; falls back to `wss://<cloudHost>` over CA-signed TLS (skip pinning on this hostname only — LAN keeps pinning). Absent ⇒ LAN-only pairing. |

Mobile parsing: treat `cloudHost` as optional and forward-compatible. New
fields may appear in future builds — existing fields will never change
meaning.

## Known oddities / cleanup candidates

These are documented for the next protocol pass — none block v1.

- `qrz-lookup` and `lookup-call` are siblings; one is the inbound C→S
  alias and one is the S→C result, but the names look symmetric. Worth
  renaming the result to `lookup-call-result` in v2.
- `sdp` and `ice` (C→S) predate the unified `signal` envelope. Already
  redundant; keep accepting them for legacy clients but stop sending
  them from new clients.
- `vfo-profiles` is bidirectional (push of profile list S→C; the new
  list after edit C→S). Renaming the C→S form to `vfo-profiles-set`
  would be cleaner; left as-is for compatibility.
- `toggle-rotor` is a stub; no rotator integration exists yet. Either
  delete or build the feature in v2.
- The `status` message is a kitchen-sink snapshot. Splitting it into
  topical messages (`vfo-status`, `rig-meters`, `rig-flags`) would
  reduce wire chatter, but bumps the protocol version.
