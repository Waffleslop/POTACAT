# ECHOCAT WebSocket Protocol Reference

This is the catalog of every WebSocket message that flows between POTACAT
desktop and an ECHOCAT client (browser today, native mobile app coming).
The schemas of record live in [`lib/echocat-protocol.js`](../lib/echocat-protocol.js).
This document is the human index — what each message means and which feature
uses it.

## Versioning

The current protocol version is **`1`**. See `PROTOCOL_VERSION` in
`lib/echocat-protocol.js`.

A connecting client should send `{type: 'hello', protocolVersion, clientVersion, clientPlatform}`
immediately after the WebSocket opens. The server replies with
`{type: 'hello', protocolVersion, serverVersion, capabilities}`. If the
major version differs by more than 1, either side should close with code
`4001` ("protocol version unsupported"). Within the same major, missing
features should be advertised through the `capabilities` array on the
server `hello`, so the client can hide UI for things the server doesn't
yet support.

The legacy browser web app does **not** send a `hello` — when the server
sees its first message be `auth` instead of `hello`, it falls back to
protocol-version 0 behavior (which is "everything works as it did before
the handshake was added"). This is the v0 ↔ v1 compatibility bridge that
keeps the existing browser path working unchanged. See
`lib/echocat-protocol.js > LEGACY_FIRST_MESSAGE_TYPES` for the allowed
legacy first messages.

> **Live-desktop caveat:** the v1 server hello only fires on a desktop
> running a build that includes commits `62bec7e` + `44c1aac` or later.
> A desktop running an older binary still serves the legacy v0 path
> (no server `hello` is sent). If your client connects and times out
> waiting for the server's `hello`, check that the desktop has been
> restarted onto the new build. Don't assume v1 capabilities just
> because the desktop repo is on v1 — the running process still
> matters. (Gap 4, mobile dev report 2026-05-03.)

## Connection lifecycle

```
client                                 server
  |---- TLS handshake ----------------> |
  |---- WS upgrade -------------------> |
  | <---- {type:'hello', ...} --------- |  (skipped pre-v1; legacy clients see auth-mode first)
  |---- {type:'hello', ...} ----------> |
  | <---- {type:'auth-mode', mode} ---- |
  |---- {type:'auth', ...} -----------> |
  | <---- {type:'auth-ok'|'auth-fail'} -|
  |  ... feature messages flow ...      |
```

## Message catalog

Format: each row is `name — direction — purpose`. Directions:
**S→C** (server-to-client), **C→S** (client-to-server), **↔** (both).

### Handshake / auth / connection

| Message | Dir | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `hello` | ↔ | Version + capability handshake (new in v1). |
| `auth-mode` | S→C | Tell client which auth mode the server is configured for (`token`, `callsign`, `cloud`). |
| `auth` | C→S | Submit credentials (token / callsign+password / cloud token). |
| `auth-ok` | S→C | Auth succeeded. Bundles initial feature flags and settings. |
| `auth-fail` | S→C | Auth rejected with reason. |
| `kicked` | S→C | Server bumped this client because another connected. |
| `pong` | S→C | Reply to `ping` for connection health checks. |
| `ping` | C→S | Latency / liveness probe. |

### Spots and sources

| Message | Dir | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `spots` | S→C | Bulk push of current spot list. |
| `sources` | S→C | Which spot sources are currently enabled (POTA, SOTA, etc.). |
| `set-sources` | C→S | Toggle which spot sources to subscribe to. |
| `echo-filters` | S→C | Server-side filter state (band/mode/distance). |
| `set-echo-filters` | C→S | Update server-side filter state. |
| `worked-parks` | S→C | List of park refs the user has worked (drives ATNO badges). |
| `worked-qsos` | S→C | List of recent worked callsigns/refs (drives "worked" highlighting). |

### Rig control / VFO

The `status` message is a kitchen-sink snapshot. The canonical fields are:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `freq` | number | Hz. **Not `frequency`.** |
| `mode` | string | "USB", "LSB", "CW", "PKTUSB", "FREEDV-RADEV1", … |
| `band` | string | "20m", "40m", … (derived from freq) |
| `catConnected` | boolean | true when CAT or SmartSDR is up |
| `txState` | boolean | true while transmitting |
| `rigType` | string | "flex", "yaesu", "icom", "kenwood", "rigctld", "wsjtx" |
| `nb` | boolean | Noise blanker on/off |
| `atu` | boolean | ATU enabled |
| `vfo` | string | "A" or "B" |
| `filterWidth` | number | Hz |
| `rfgain` | number | 0–255 |
| `txpower` | number | TX power *setting* (slider) |
| `smeter` | number | live S-meter (Gap 10) |
| `swr` | number | live SWR (Gap 10) |
| `alc` | number | live ALC (Gap 10) |
| `power` | number | live wattmeter (Gap 10) |
| `capabilities` | object | per-rig feature flags (filter, nb, atu, vfo, rfgain, txpower, power) |
| `vfoLocked` | boolean | VFO lock active |
| `audioState` | string | WebRTC connection state (when ECHOCAT audio bridge is up) |

**`tune` C→S sends `freqKhz` (string), not `frequency` (number)**.
The kHz-as-string format is the legacy wire shape and the desktop
parses it as a float — see Gap 5 in `potacat-app/docs/echocat-protocol-gaps.md`
for the history.

### Cloud (cross-device QSO sync via Cognito)

> **Scope:** These messages exist solely for the in-browser ECHOCAT UI
> (`renderer/remote.html` Settings → Cloud Sync, wired in
> `renderer/remote.js:8132-8289`), which piggybacks on the desktop's
> cloud session over WebSocket. The iOS and Android apps do **not** use
> these — they speak to `api.potacat.com` directly over HTTPS via their
> own `CloudAuth` / `CloudSync` clients. Don't infer from the protocol
> registry that mobile is expected to send them; that path was never
> wired on the native apps and was retired from the mobile protocol
> registry in the 2026-05-27 cleanup. The desktop-side handlers stay in
> place to serve the browser ECHOCAT.

## Cross-references

- Server → client send sites: `lib/remote-server.js` — search `_sendTo(`,
  `broadcast*`, `this._client.send`.
- Server → client message constructors and lifecycle:
  `lib/remote-server.js` lines 597–1736 cover the bulk.
- Client → server send sites: `renderer/remote.js` — search
  `ws.send(JSON.stringify({type:`.
- Client inbound dispatcher: `renderer/remote.js` — search
  `function handleMessage` / the big `switch (msg.type)`.
- Schemas of record: [`lib/echocat-protocol.js`](../lib/echocat-protocol.js).
- Protocol tests: [`test/echocat-protocol.test.js`](../test/echocat-protocol.test.js).
- Headless smoke client: [`scripts/echocat-cli.js`](../scripts/echocat-cli.js).

## Known oddities / cleanup candidates

These are documented for the next protocol pass — none block v1.

- `qrz-lookup` and `lookup-call` are siblings; one is the inbound C→S
  alias and one is the S→C result, but the names look symmetric. Worth
  renaming the result to `lookup-call-result` in v2.
- `sdp` and `ice` (C→S) predate the unified `signal` envelope. Already
  redundant; keep accepting them for legacy clients but stop sending
  them from new clients.
- `vfo-profiles` is bidirectional (push of profile list S→C; the new
  list after edit C→S). Renaming the C→S form to `vfo-profiles-set`
  would be cleaner; left as-is for compatibility.
- `toggle-rotor` is a stub; no rotator integration exists yet. Either
  delete or build the feature in v2.
- The `status` message is a kitchen-sink snapshot. Splitting it into
  topical messages (`vfo-status`, `rig-meters`, `rig-flags`) would
  reduce wire chatter, but bumps the protocol version.
